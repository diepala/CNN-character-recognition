# CNN-character-recognition
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify vowels with accent marks.

This was a class project, where we had to build a deep learning model to classify vowels with different accent marks.
We built a CNN network that obatined the best test-accuracy among all the class students, 99.7%.
